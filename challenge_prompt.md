# E7 AI DEMOSCENE CHALLENGE
## "Making obsolete hardware sing with 2025 AI techniques"

You are participating in the **E7 AI Demoscene Challenge** - a comprehensive benchmark designed to test advanced AI capabilities in reverse engineering, system design, and creative optimization.

## YOUR MISSION

Transform the 2011 Nokia E7 into a showcase of modern software engineering, creating "demos" that push the hardware beyond its original limitations through clever algorithms and hyper-efficient code.

## THE PLATFORM: Nokia E7 (RM-626)

Your "metal" to program close to the silicon:

- **CPU:** ARM11 (ARM1136J-S) @ 600MHz  
- **RAM:** 256MB total system memory
- **Display:** 640Ã—360 pixels, 16M colors
- **Camera:** 8MP fixed-focus (EDOF) - primary optimization target
- **Storage:** eMMC flash + microSD support
- **Connectivity:** 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth, micro-USB

**Key Challenge:** Undocumented silicon features await discovery and exploitation.

## THE DEMOS: Your Software Showcases

Create three demonstrations of technical artistry:

### ðŸŽ¨ VISUAL DEMO: Computational Photography Engine
**Challenge:** Overcome the fixed-focus camera limitation through algorithmic innovation.

**Requirements:**
- Design novel enhancement algorithms (burst processing, noise reduction, depth effects)
- Implement efficient processing pipeline for 8MP images
- Achieve measurable quality improvements over original camera
- Constraint: Must run on 600MHz ARM11 with real-time or near-real-time performance

**Inspiration:** Google Pixel computational photography, adapted for extreme constraints

### ðŸ’¬ CONNECTIVITY DEMO: Ultra-Efficient LLM Client
**Challenge:** Enable modern AI chat functionality on 2011 hardware.

**Requirements:**
- Design optimal protocol for LLM communication (consider custom tokenization)
- Create minimal, responsive UI optimized for 640Ã—360 + physical keyboard
- Implement efficient memory management for conversation history
- Constraint: Smooth operation within 256MB RAM limits

**Innovation Opportunity:** Novel interface paradigms for keyboard+touchscreen combination

### ðŸŽ® SYSTEM DEMO: Procedural UX Engine
**Challenge:** Generate modern UI elements at runtime vs storing static assets.

**Requirements:**
- Implement procedural generation of interface elements
- Create smooth animations and transitions
- Design adaptive layouts for different content types
- Constraint: Minimal memory footprint, GPU acceleration if available

**Philosophy:** Demoscene approach - effects over assets, code over data

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

**Hardware Realities:**
- Only 2 physical Nokia E7 devices available - **no destructive testing**
- Must use emulation for development and validation before hardware deployment

## BEGIN THE CHALLENGE

**Start with Phase 1: Firmware Archaeology**

Your first task is to analyze the firmware container structure in `firmware/RM-626_111.040.1511_79u_prd.core.fpsx`.

1. Design and implement a parser for the .fpsx container format
2. Extract and identify all firmware components  
3. Begin reverse engineering the main system drivers
4. Document hardware register mappings discovered in the process

**Remember:** 
- Generate working code, not just theoretical descriptions
- Ask for approval before proceeding to Phase 2
- Think like a demoscene coder - every byte and cycle matters

## Ready to prove that AI can surpass the original Nokia engineers at their own hardware?

**Time to burn some tokens and make obsolete silicon sing! ðŸ”¥**
